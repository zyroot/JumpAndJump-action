properties in CCClass can not be abbreviated if they are of type RawAsset.
Please use the complete form.
For example, if the type is Texture2D, the previous definition is:
    jumpAudio: cc.Texture2D,
Now it should be changed to:
    jumpAudio: {
      type: cc.Texture2D // use 'type:' to define Texture2D object directly
      default: null,     // object's default value is null
